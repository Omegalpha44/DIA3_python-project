DIA3 project - group Charles, Paul, Jeanne

The goal is to create a model for our dataset that will predict if a consumer is going to buy something on the web or not, based on his/her previous behavior.

The dataset is composed of 17 features and 1 target

The dataset does not contain null values from the get go, but contains different types of data (int, float, object)

We will first clean the dataset, then we will try to find the best model to predict the target.

models tested : 
- Logistic Regression
- Kmeans
- Dbscan
- Deep Learning

In the end, the best model seems to be the Deep learning model, with a precision of 0.97
